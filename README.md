# Compassionate Care Emporium

My Capstone Project is an E-Commerce site catering to all the dedicated individuals who selflessly take care of a loved one. The idea is based from my own experience with moving back home to care for my amazing Mom for the last 7 years of her life. There are 3 main sections:
1. Products to make a loved ones journey more comfortable such as medical supplies and accessibility items
2. Self-Care for the Caregiver as it's very common for caregivers to ignore their own needs
3. The Bereaved Caregiver - resources and products to help with coping after the loss of a loved one
The site will also have a space to connect with other caregivers and a place to find local resources

What I would like to include in my site:

1. Register for an account: Users can create accounts and log in to the website
2. Contact Details: Users can store their name and contact details such as email and phone number
3. Addresses: Users can add one or more addresses to their account and set a default shipping address
4. Payment Methods: Users can add one or more payment methods to their account and can set a default payment method
5. Products: The webite can store a large number of products
6. Categories: Each product belongs to a categoryand categories can belong to other categories
7. Product Variations: Each product can have different variations,  such as different colors or sizes
8. Number in Stock: The website should keep track of the number of each item in stock
9. Shopping Cart: Visitors can add one or more products to their shoppng cart 
10. Payment details for the Order: A user needs to provide their payment details and address details as part of placing an order
11. Shipping Method: The user can select a shipping method from a list of methods. 
12. Order Status: The order and shipping process follows several stages once the order is placed, such as processing, delivery in progress, and delivered
